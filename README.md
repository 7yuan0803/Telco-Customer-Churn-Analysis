# Telco Customer Churn Analysis  
Predicting customer churn using machine learning to support telecom retention strategy.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies the complete predictive analytics workflow to analyze the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset.  
The primary objective is to identify key factors that drive customer churn and develop predictive models to support proactive retention strategies.

This repository contains all required components for the ISOM 835 Predictive Analytics Term Project, including notebooks, final report, visualizations, and documentation.

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts**, **high monthly charges**, and **electronic check payment methods** exhibit significantly higher churn.  
- Tenure is a strong churn indicator—customers in early months are most likely to leave.  
- **Random Forest** outperformed Logistic Regression with higher accuracy and better feature importance interpretation.  
- Top predictive features:  
  - Contract type  
  - Tenure  
  - Monthly charges  
  - Tech support availability  

These factors provide clear direction for targeted retention campaigns.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Encourage customers to switch to **one-year or two-year contracts** through promotions.  
- Provide **discount bundles** to customers with high monthly charges.  
- Improve **technical support services** to enhance customer satisfaction.  
- Use model predictions for **early-stage churn intervention**, focusing on new customers.  

---

## ⚖️ Responsible AI & Ethics  
Topics addressed in the report include:

- Identifying potential sources of bias in demographic attributes  
- Ensuring fair treatment across customer segments  
- Avoiding discriminatory practices in targeting or retention programs  
- Maintaining transparency in model use and communication  
- Ethical considerations for deploying predictive models in customer-facing decisions
